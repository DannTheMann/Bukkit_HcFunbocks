# HcFunbocks

- Not nearly as old as others.
- Much more object-friendly within the language.
- Uses serialisation to store all data, maps, locations etc.
- Had a few bugs that I never got round to fixing, located in bugs.txt
- Used a few APIs (Vault, BarAPI, WeaponGenerator which was my API)

An old arena wave based plugin, the premise was...

You have the funbocks master who would lead the games, 
spawn monsters and try to kill the funbocks players as
quickly as possible and stopping them from getting high
round survival bonuses.

The longer a player survived, the more money and loot
they earned. The player who survived the longest
would be able to choose a reward considered of 
high luxury.

Every 4-5 rounds a boss round would occur, and for every round
except the first round or a boss round there was a 1/10 chance
for a PVP round to be declared in which 1/5 of all current survivors
had to be eliminated for the round to end. 

Every 3 rounds there were loot drops to help players.

Players killed enemies and in return earned points which could be
spent at the end of each round in a shop (Lasting 30 seconds) to 
upgrade their stats to try and last longer.

The funbocks master had powers that increased as the round incremented.

One of my personal favourite plugins, shame I couldn't iron out a few bugs.
